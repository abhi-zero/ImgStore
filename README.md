## Getting Started
1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**
   - No build step or server is required; all dependencies are loaded via CDN.

## Dependencies
- [GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/): For advanced timeline-based animations.
- [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/): For modern, scalable vector icons.

Both dependencies are included via CDN in `index.html`:
```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/remixicon@4.5.0/fonts/remixicon.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.13.0/gsap.min.js"></script>
```

## Customization
- **Images:** Replace the images in `assets/images/` with your own to personalize the gallery.
- **Text:** Edit the headings and descriptions in `index.html` to match your content.
- **Styles:** Modify `styles/style.css` for custom themes or layouts.


## Inspiration & Credits
- **Project Idea:** Inspired by the [Sheriyan YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Sheriyan) (idea source), but all code is written by me from scratch.
- **Design Reference:** The layout and animation aim to closely match the original design showcased here: [Fi Store on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/4986428-Fi-Store).
- **Note:** This is not a fully polished project yet. In the future, I plan to add new techniques and improvements to enhance the gallery further.
